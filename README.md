# FobX

FobX is a state management library inspired by the great work of [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx), and functionally, is nearly identical for most use cases. The entire library has been written from scratch with tree-shaking, bundle size, and performance in mind. The goal of FobX is not to be a direct replacement of MobX and therefore will not attempt to maintain feature parity with it.
